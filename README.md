# pkg-bird2
Debs for the BGP daemon bird2 ( for debian and ubuntu )

## Notes for debian users above Buster

`bird2` (and `bird` is for 1.6) is now natively in the repo's. you should use that rather than this. Be aware that upgrading from this bird2 package to debian/ubuntu bird2 will change bird's config file from /etc/bird2/* to /etc/bird/
